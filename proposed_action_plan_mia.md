## Roadmap of Process (FOR DATA ANALYTICS) 

1. Preprocessing of dataset:
  - What are the variables with the greatest level of correlation?
  - What are the variables that seem to provide the least amount of information?
  - How many NA values exist within the dataset?
  - What are the key predictors we are going to select for:
    Facebook 
    Twitter 
 
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Scatterplot Matrix (of the entire variable)
  - Boxplots of correlations
  - Wordcloud (technique learnt in the first link)
  
  What are surprising correlations/links? 
  
  3. Classification:
  - Unsupervised Classification: k-means clustering + standardizing attributes
  - Supervised Classification: Decision trees/random forests, logistic regression, 
  
  4. Predictive Analytics:
  -  Using decision trees, predict the variables that most directly affect the outcome. 
  - Using logistic/poisson regression, estimate the categorical variables that tell the customer who is most likely to affect/resonate with crisis reporting. 
  - LASSO Regression (basically considers all variables jointly, and shrinks to the most 'fit' models')
